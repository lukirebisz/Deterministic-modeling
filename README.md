# Deterministic-modeling
Project: biology

Let's imagine that a little kitten was born and the distribution of the pigment in its skin is random.

Cat owner is very interesting what the animal's pus will look like in the future.

In this project we analyze that problem using differential equations (FitzHugh-Nagumo model of activation and disactivation of neurons).
